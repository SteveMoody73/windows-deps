 
This is a minimum version of Alembic 0.9.3.

For technical reason, some of the getter methods are declared as non-constant
member methods, this breaks our exists reading function, in our minimum version,
all getter methods we are using have been modified to be constant.

We also use compiling flag "Werror" in release build, in this version of Alembic,
all unused variable and functions have been removed.
